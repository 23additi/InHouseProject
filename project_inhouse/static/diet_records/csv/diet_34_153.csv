"**Note:**  Calorie counts are approximate and can vary based on ingredients and portion sizes.  The ""Nutrients"" column provides a general overview; a full nutritional breakdown would be significantly more extensive.  This meal plan prioritizes common North Indian vegetarian dishes.  Adjust portion sizes to meet individual caloric needs.  Consider adding spices for flavor and health benefits (turmeric", cumin, coriander, etc.).
